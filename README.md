# Number-guessing-game-in-Python
This is basic number guessing game that I have created in python project for beginners.
The main steps for this program are as follows:
  1) Build a Number guessing game, in which the user selects a range.
  2) Let’s say User selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer.
  3) Some random integer will be selected by the system and the user has to guess that integer in the minimum number of guesses.
  4) We are using an alogorithm this project which is  [Minimum number of guessing = log2(Upper bound – lower bound + 1)] and in terms of python you can write this alorithm as [round(m.log(upper-lower+1,2)].
